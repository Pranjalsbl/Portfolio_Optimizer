# Programming Language used: 
**PYTHON**

# Dataset-
Yahoo Finance
PyPl library : yfinance

# Idea to choose this project:
Big investors have enough money to hire portfolio makers but the common man who has a small investment amount has no extra money to hire a portfolio maker so this application helps these  people to invest their money in an optimized way with low risk and high return.

# Short Discription:
The portfolio optimization problem becomes more complex  when a number of constraints is present. The existing multiobjective computing methods also require suitable modifications to suit the portfolio optimization problem. It can be optimized by applying many evolutionary/swarm computing techniques and genetic algorithms . In this project, we are going to use these soft computing techniques to get an optimized portfolio that works on different realistic constraints.
